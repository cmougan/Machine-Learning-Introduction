# Machine-Learning-Introduction
This is a project that I have done where I have used some of the algorithms of ML (KNN regression, KNN classifiers, Linear, Linear Lasso, Linear Ridge, Polynomial, Polynomial Ridge, Polynomial Lasso, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
In this file I apply the Machine Learning algorithms to a Kaggle dataset, I compare them, tunned them and give a small review of what they do.
